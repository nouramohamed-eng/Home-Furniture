# 🛋️ Luxury Home Furniture Store - Landing Page

A premium, high-end e-commerce landing page designed for a modern furniture retailer. This project focuses on high-impact visual storytelling, clean typography, and a seamless shopping experience across all devices.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Home Furniture** landing page is a sophisticated front-end project that highlights various furniture categories—from living rooms to professional offices. It features a parallax-style hero section, structured product grids, and a fully responsive navigation system designed for high conversion rates.

## ✨ Key Technical Features

* **Parallax Hero Experience:** The main header uses `background-attachment: fixed` to create a smooth depth effect as users scroll through the promotional content.
* **Advanced Navigation System:**
* **Dual-Tier Navbar:** Separates shop categories (Shop All, Decor, Office) from user utility links (Story, Contact, Login).
* **Dynamic Cart Counter:** Includes a custom icon with badge support for displaying cart item counts.
* **Mobile-Ready:** Features a hidden `toggle-menu` that activates via media queries for devices under `920px`.


* **Responsive Layout Architecture:**
* **CSS Grid:** Powerfully aligns brand logos in the sponsored section and structures the complex four-column footer.
* **Flexbox:** Manages the fluid alignment of the navigation bar, hero content, and product cards.
* **Breakpoint Optimization:** Includes specific styling for wide screens, tablets (`1024px`), and mobile phones (`920px`).


* **Interactive UI Components:**
* **Floating Action Buttons:** Fixed sidebar buttons for "BUY NOW" and "Customize" that remain accessible during scrolling.
* **Product Badges:** Elegant "Sale!" tags and interactive icons positioned over product images.
* **Tailored Selection:** A custom text selection color (`background-color: var(--icon-color-)`) that matches the project's brand palette.



## 🛠 Technology Stack

* **HTML5:** Structured with semantic tags to ensure better SEO and code readability.
* **CSS3:** Utilizes modern variables (`:root`), complex transitions, and multi-breakpoint media queries.
* **Google Fonts:** Specifically uses the **Oswald** font family (weights 200-700) for a bold, upscale typographic feel.
* **SVG Icons:** Scalable vector graphics used for search, shopping baskets, and social media links.

* **Headings:** Deep Black `rgb(0, 0, 0)` for maximum readability.
* **Body Text:** Muted Gray `rgb(99, 99, 99)` for a clean look.
